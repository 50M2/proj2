<h1>I didnt really know what to do for this page so I have attached the first 30 lines of The Bee Movie script!</h1>
  <p>According to all known laws of aviation, there is no way a bee should be able to fly.</p>
  <p>Its wings are too small to get its fat little body off the ground.</p>
  <p>The bee, of course, flies anyway because bees don't care what humans think is impossible.</p>
  <p>Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black.</p>
  <p>Ooh, black and yellow!</p>
  <p>Let's shake it up a little.</p>
  <p>Barry! Breakfast is ready!</p>
